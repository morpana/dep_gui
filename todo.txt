to do:
roboy_dep:

1. get good plots of recorded data
	whats good?
	apply some filtering to give clearer results?
	what frequencies can we safely get rid of i.e. we are not interested in?
2. identify critical sections
3. create metrics for comparing critical sections

4. re-record i) fb to fs i) fb to sd

experiments:
1. transitions
	objective: transition from behavior to another maintaining as much of original behavior characteristics as possible
	experiments:
	i) obtain 3 behavior pairs
	ii) 3 transfer funtions:
		a) step
			Variables:
			i) when transition is performed -> 8 trigger points
		b) ramp
			Variables:
			i) how quickly (period) -> (1.0,2.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,50.0,100.0)
			First hardest transition: fs to sd
		c) portion of sine
			Variables:
			i) how quickly (period) -> (1.0,2.0,5.0,10.0,20.0,50.0,100.0)
			First hardest transition: fs to sd
	data:
	- tendon space: position, velocity and force
	- video recording (regular camera) -- for qualitative evaluation
	- joint space: elbow angle
	evaluation:
	- how smooth is the transition?
	- transient duration?

2. new motions...

- analyse data in python
	- read data from bags
	- visualize data
	- frequency domain representation?
